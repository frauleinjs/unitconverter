# unitconverter
Convert distances (km ↔ miles), temperature (°C ↔ °F), weights (kg ↔ lbs), etc. Uses a simple menu system.

1. Introduction
Unit conversion is a common problem in computer programming, particularly when dealing with different measurement systems. The mathematical formulas for conversions are simple, but determining the correct method and implementing it successfully is not always simple. This project meets the need for a C# program that converts units such as distance, temperature, and weight, providing programmers with a simple but useful solution.

2. Problem Statement (Optional)
There are many applications requiring users in different domains or fields to have unit conversions, but implementing these conversions in an accessible manner is not simple. It is difficult for developers to create intuitive and comprehensible interfaces to select and convert the units accordingly.

3. Objective
The objective of the project is to create a simple, menu-driven C# program that facilitates easy conversions between normal measurements of distance, temperature, and weight. The notion is to provide an end-user with a simple but robust tool and to address some of the typical issues in applying unit conversion in C#.

4. Features
Unit Conversion: Support for conversion of distance (km ↔ miles), temperature (°C ↔ °F), and weight (kg ↔ lbs).

 Simple Menu System: Trivial navigation using a console-based menu.

Interactive User Input: The user can select the conversion type and input values for the conversion.

 Error Handling: User inputs are validated, and feedback is given.

5. Tools and Techniques
C#: The programming language the unit converter is written in.

 Console Application: A text-based menu system is utilized as the user interface.

 Mathematical Conversion Formulas: Trivial conversion formulas are applied for every unit type.

6. Demo Sample
The program displays a menu by which the user chooses the conversion type to be performed (distance, temperature, or weight). After a conversion type has been selected, the user inputs the value, and the program converts it, displaying the result to the user. The user can continue converting or exit the application at will.
